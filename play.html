        PETER. No, no, boy; no man could live if he took his neighbour's pack
        on his shoulders. (_Enter VERA in peasant's dress._) Well, my girl,
        you've been long enough away--where is the letter?
        
        VERA. There is none to-day, Father.
        
        PETER. I knew it.
        
        VERA. But there will be one to-morrow, Father.
        
        PETER. Curse him, for an ungrateful son.
        
        VERA. Oh, Father, don't say that; he must be sick.
        
        PETER. Ay! sick of profligacy, perhaps.
        
        VERA. How dare you say that of him, Father? You know that is not true.
        
        PETER. Where does the money go, then? Michael, listen. I gave Dmitri
        half his mother's fortune to bring with him to pay the lawyer folk of
        Moscow. He has only written three times, and every time for more money.
        He got it, not at my wish, but at hers (_pointing to VERA_), and now for
        five months, close on six almost, we have heard nothing from him.
        
        VERA. Father, he will come back.
        
        PETER. Ay! the prodigals always return; but let him never darken my
        doors again.
        
        VERA (_sitting down pensive_). Some evil has come on him; he must be
        dead! Oh! Michael, I am so wretched about Dmitri.
        
        MICH. Will you never love any one but him, Vera?
        
        VERA (_smiling_). I don't know; there is so much else to do in the world
        but love.
        
        MICH. Nothing else worth doing, Vera.
        
        PETER. What noise is that, Vera? (_A metallic clink is heard._)
        
        VERA (_rising and going to the door_). I don't know, Father; it is not
        like the cattle bells, or I would think Nicholas had come from the fair.
        Oh! Father! it is soldiers!--coming down the hill--there is one of them
        on horseback. How pretty they look! But there are some men with them
        with chains on! They must be robbers. Oh! don't let them in, Father; I
        couldn't look at them.
        
        PETER. Men in chains! Why, we are in luck, my child! I heard this was to
        be the new road to Siberia, to bring the prisoners to the mines; but I
        didn't believe it. My fortune is made! Bustle, Vera, bustle! I'll die a
        rich man after all. There will be no lack of good customers now. An
        honest man should have the chance of making his living out of rascals
        now and then.
        
        VERA. Are these men rascals, Father? What have they done?
        
        PETER. I reckon they're some of those Nihilists the priest warns us
        against. Don't stand there idle, my girl.
        
        VERA. I suppose, then, they are all wicked men.
        
        (_Sound of soldiers outside; cry of "Halt!" enter Russian officer with a
        body of soldiers and eight men in chains, raggedly dressed; one of them
        on entering hurriedly puts his coat above his ears and hides his face;
        some soldiers guard the door, others sit down; the prisoners stand._)
        
        COLONEL. Innkeeper!
