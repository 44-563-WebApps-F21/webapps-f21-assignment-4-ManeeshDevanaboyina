    <h3>Vera or, The Nihilists</h3>
    <h5>ACT III - This Show shows the description about Act III in vera or, The Nihilists</h5>
    <p style="white-space: pre">

        <h5>VERA</h5> <p>Devil! Who lured you into the lion's den?</p>

        <h5>CONSPS</h5> <p>Kill him! kill him![4]</p>
        
        <h5>PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p>En vérité, Messieurs, you are not over-hospitable in your
        welcome.</p>
        
        <h5>VERA</h5> <p>Welcome! What welcome should we give you but the dagger or the
        noose?</p>
        
        <h5>PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p>I had no idea, really, that the Nihilists were so
        exclusive. Let me assure you that if I had not always had an _entree_
        to the very best society, and the very worst conspiracies, I could never
        have been Prime Minister in Russia.</p>
        
        <h5>VERA</h5> <p>The tiger cannot change its nature, nor the snake lose its venom;
        but are you turned a lover of the people?</p>
        
        <h5>PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p>Mon Dieu, non, Mademoiselle! I would much sooner talk
        scandal in a drawing-room than treason in a cellar. Besides, I hate the
        common mob, who smell of garlic, smoke bad tobacco, get up early, and
        dine off one dish.</p>
        
        <h5>PRES</h5> <p>What have you to gain, then, by a revolution?</p>
                
        <h5>PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p>You want money, of course. No one ever joins a conspiracy
        who has any. Here. <p>(_Throws money on table._)</p> You have so many spies
        that I should think you want information. Well, you will find me the
        best informed man in Russia on the abuses of our Government. I made them
        nearly all myself.</p>

        <h5>PRES</h5><p><p>(_holding out dagger and a paper_)</p> Prince Paul, the dagger or the
        oath?</p>
